  "nbb entry point. The compiled cljs.main run is the other half — see
  test/columnar/cljs_runner.cljs. Both, because SCI interpretation cannot
  stand in for real compilation and vice versa.

  Every `*_test.cljc` under test/ has to be required here AND in the compiled
  runner. Until 2026-08-17 both required only `columnar.engine-test`, so each
  ClojureScript half ran 10 of the suite's 36 tests and reported green: the
  26 tests and 63 assertions in `evolve-test` and `group-test` that the JVM
  run covered were invisible on this side.

  That is not a coverage gap that shows up as a smaller number, because
  nothing prints the number it should have been. Measured on the day it was
  found: `group/group` was altered to drop the last group from every result,
  a defect the JVM suite catches immediately — the partial runner reported
  `Ran 10 tests ... 0 failures` and exited 0. A runner that tests a third of
  the suite returns the same value as one that tests all of it."
