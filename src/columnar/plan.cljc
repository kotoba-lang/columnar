  "Decide what not to read, then read it.

  Two properties this namespace is built around, both of them things a scan
  can get wrong while still looking right:

  - **A column is read only if the query needs it.** The columns in the
    predicates and the columns in the projection, and nothing else. On a wide
    table this is most of the saving, and it is invisible in the answer.
  - **A chunk is read only if statistics could not rule it out.** And when
    they could not, the predicate is still applied exactly — pruning decides
    what to read, never what matches (`columnar.stats`).

  `scan` reports `:chunks-read` and `:chunks-skipped` alongside the rows. Not
  telemetry: a caller cannot otherwise distinguish a plan that pruned from
  one that read everything and filtered, because both produce the same rows."

  "`scan` shaped for `kotobase.lake.tabular/ITabularEngine`.

  `request` is `{:columns [..] :row n-or-nil :filters [[col value] ..]}`.

  row-number restriction — which prunes chunks too, because a row number
  names a chunk.
